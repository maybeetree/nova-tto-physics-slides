# Electricity grid

- **Energy loss** due to heat
- Less loss at **higher voltage**
    - As high as **380kV**

# Voltage Levels

- High-voltage grid: 380kV
- Distribution stations: 380kV down to 10kV
- Residential areas: 10kV down to 230V
    - 230V is called **mains voltage**

# Effective voltage

- In the electrical grid, voltage alternates between
    325V and -325V
- In practice, we talk about **effective voltage** of 230V

# Transformers

- 230V is too high for phones, small lights, etc.
- **Transformers** step down

# Step-up and Step-down

- $U_p$: voltage on the primary
- $U_s$: voltage on the secondary
- $N_p$: turns on the primary
- $N_s$: turns on the secondary

$$ \frac{U_p}{U_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} $$

- For **ideal transformer**, power is equal on both sides:

    $P_p = P_s$
    or
    $U_p \cdot I_p = U_s \cdot I_s$
