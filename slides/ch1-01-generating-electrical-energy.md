# Chapter 1 Part 1: Generating electrical energy

Learning objectives (p. 10)

1. Parts of a power station
1. Induction voltage
1. Electrical power supply and consumption
1. Joules
1. Prefixes and powers of ten
1. Power, peak wattage, and energy

# Power Station

1. Burn fuel to boil water into steam
1. Steam spins turbine
1. Turbine spins generator
1. Generator makes electrical energy

- After passing thru the turbine,
    the steam turns back into water.

# Coolant water

The steam used to spin the turbines is sometimes
cooled using water from an external source,
such as a lake.

# Induction voltage

A moving magnet can induce voltage in a coil of wire

# Rotating magnet is more practical than moving magnet

# Electrical Power Supply

- **electrical power** of a power station
    is the maximum amount of **electrical energy**
    that a power station can **supply** (produce)
    *in one second*
- Electrical power is measured in **watts**.
    A typical power station can supply
    *hundreds of megawatts*.

# Electrical Power Consumption

- Devices **consume electrical energy**
- Energy is never destroyed -- it changes form
    - For example, a light bulb consumes electrical energy
        and produces light and heat.
