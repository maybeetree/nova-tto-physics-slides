# Electrical Power Supply

- **electrical power** of a power station
    is the maximum amount of **electrical energy**
    that a power station can **supply** (produce)
    *in one second*
- Electrical power is measured in **watts**.
    A typical power station can supply
    *hundreds of megawatts*.

# Electrical Power Consumption

- Devices **consume electrical energy**
- Energy is never destroyed -- it changes form
    - For example, a light bulb consumes electrical energy
        and produces light and heat.

# Calculating energy consumption

- $E$: energy in joules [J]
- $P$: power in watts [W]
- $t$: time in seconds [s]

$$E = P \cdot t$$

$$P = \frac{E}{t}$$

# Example exercise 1

The LED lamp lights up for 2.0 minutes when the sensor in the lamp
detects a movement.
Calculate the energy consumption of the light in kJ.

![LED lamp with sensor](img/led-lamp.jpg)

Given:
- $P = 10 \text{W}$
- $t = 20 \text{min} = 120 \text{s}$

Required:
- $E = ?$


# Example exercise 1 - answer

Given:

- $P = 10 \text{W}$
- $t = 20 \text{min} = 120 \text{s}$

Required:

- $E = \text{?}$

Working:

- $E = P \cdot t = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{J} = 1.2 \text{kJ}$

# Example exercise 2

The Enecogen power station (capacity 870 MW) ran at an average
of 60% of its full capacity in the week of 7-13 October.
Calculate how much electrical energy this power station
supplied in that week (7.0 days).

Given:

- $P = \text{60\% of 870 MW} = \text{522 MW} = 5.22 \cdot 10^8 \text{W}$
- $t = \text{7.0 days} = 6.05 \cdot 10^5 \text{s}$

Required:

- $E = \text{?}$

# Example exercise 2 -- answer

Given:

- $P = \text{60\% of 870 MW} = \text{ 522 MW} = 5.22 \cdot 10^*8 \text{W}$
- $t = \text{7.0 days} = 6.05 \cdot 10^5 \text{s}$

Required:

- $E = \text{?}$

Working:

- $E = P \cdot s = 5.22 \cdot 10^8 = 6.05 \cdot 10^5 = 32 \cdot 10^14 \text{J}$

Emily reads the following information on a website:

> The peak wattage (Wp) says how much power the solar
> panels can produce in the best situation.
> Reality is always different, of course,
> so you need to convert the numbers.
> In the Netherlands,
> 1 Wp produces about 3.1 MJ each year.
