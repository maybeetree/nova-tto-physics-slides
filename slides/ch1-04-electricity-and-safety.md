# Chapter 1 Section 4: Electricity and Safety

## Learning objectives

1. *Explain* the dangers of using electricity
1. *Explain* what circuit breaks and group fuses do
1. *Explain* single and double insulation
1. *Explain* earth connection and earth leakage breakers
1. *Identify* and *write down* safety features
1. *Explain* induced voltage

## Overloading and short circuits

- Overloading: too much current through wire causes heat
    and starts fire
- Short circuit: too much current flows through wires
    that are connected accidentally,
    producing heat and causing fires.

## Electric shock

- Current flowing through your body causes muscles
    to constrict, and can damage tissue

## Fuses

- Fuses burn up if too much power (normally > 16 A)
    flows through a group.
- Circuit breakers work like fuses, but can be reset
    without replacing them

## Double Insulation

- Wires have a layer of insulation (PCV) around the copper core
    to prevent shorts or shocks

- "Double insulation" means that the wires are also inside
    a hard tube

## Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers

- Current through live wire should be the same
    as current through neutral wire
- If there is a difference, some current is leaking
    to the ground
- Earth leakage circuit breaker detects that
