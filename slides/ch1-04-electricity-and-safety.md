# Chapter 1 Section 4: Electricity and Safety

## Learning objectives

1. *Explain* the dangers of using electricity
1. *Explain* what circuit breaks and group fuses do
1. *Explain* single and double insulation
1. *Explain* earth connection and earth leakage breakers
1. *Identify* and *write down* safety features
1. *Explain* induced voltage

## Overloading and short circuits

- Overloading: too much current through wire causes heat
    and starts fire
- Short circuit: too much current flows through wires
    that are connected accidentally,
    producing heat and causing fires.

## Electric shock

- Current flowing through your body causes muscles
    to constrict, and can damage tissue

## Fuses

- Fuses burn up if too much power (normally > 16 A)
    flows through a group.
- Circuit breakers work like fuses, but can be reset
    without replacing them

## Double Insulation

- Wires have a layer of insulation (PCV) around the copper core
    to prevent shorts or shocks

- "Double insulation" means that the wires are also inside
    a hard tube

## Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers

- Current through live wire should be the same
    as current through neutral wire
- If there is a difference, some current is leaking
    to the ground
- Earth leakage circuit breaker detects that

## Earthing

- Metal casings of electronic devices are connected to ground
    with a third wire in the power cable
- If the casing becomes live (due to a defect in the device),
    the electricity flows into the ground and trips the
    earth leakage breaker,
    instead of shocking a person.

## Check knowledge

1. Which **two** situations can cause the current in a group to
    become too high

1. Explain what has happened when a short circuit occurs in a device

1. How can you tell that a circuit breaker has switched
    off the power in the group?

1. How does an earth leakage circuit breaker determine that the current
    needs to be switched off?

1. In what situation does an earth leakage circuit breaker provide
    greater safety than a fuse?

## Check knowledge 2

Appliances with a metal casing (washing machine, fridge) are always earthed.

1. Why is it important that the metal casing is earthed?
1. How is the leakage current through a metal casing discharged?
1. How can you recognize and earth wire?
1. Explain why there is no point earthing the outer casing
    of a double-insulated appliance.
