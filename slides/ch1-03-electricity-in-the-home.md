# Chapter 1 Section 3: Electricity in the Home

## Learning Objectives:

1. *Describe* the domestic system
1. *Calculate* overall current and power consumption of a group
1. *Describe* wires in a domestic system and their purpose
1. *Do calculations* using power-voltage-current relationships
1. *Calculate* the consumption of electrical energy in kWh and MJ
1. [Plus] *Explain* how a circuit breaker works

## Groups

- Wiring is split up into multiple *groups*

## Groups

- Groups are wired *in parallel*
    - Same voltage in every group:
        $U = U_1 = U_2 = U_3 = ... = 230 \text{ V}$
- Sum of currents in group is the total current
    - $I_{tot} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + ...$

## Device power

- Power is the product of voltage and current
    - $P = U \cdot I$
    - $P is the power (Watts)
    - $U is the voltage (Volts)
    - $I is the current (Amps)

## Device power: experiments

## Example: total power

The following appliances are connected to one group of a
domestic supply:

- one 800 W microwave oven
- one 2000 W kettle
- one 150 W extractor fan
- six 3.0 W LED Lights

Calculate the total current of the group.

## Example - answer

$P_{tot} = 800 + 2000 + 150 + 6 \times 3.0$

$P_{tot} = 1968 \text{ W}$

$I_{tot} = \frac{P_{tot}}{U} = \frac{2968}{230}$

$I_{tot} = 12 \text{ A}$

## Energy: kWh

- kWh (kilowatt-hour) = $\text{kW} \cdot \text{h}$ = 3.6 \text{ MJ}
- One watt of energy consumed/produced over one hour
- More "understandable" unit of energy

## Example: kWh

A desk lamp runs at 6.0 W for 60 hours.
How much energy does it consume in kWh?
How much does that energy cost if 1 kWh costs 23 cents?

Given:

- $P = 6 \text{ W} = 0.0006 \text{k W}$
- $t = 60 \text{ h}$

Required:

- $E = \text{???}$

## Example - answer

Given:

- $P = 6 \text{ W} = 0.0006 \text{ kW}$
- $t = 60 \text{ h}$

Required:

- $E = \text{???}$

Working:

- $E = P \cdot t = 0.006 \times 60 = 0.36 \text{ kWh}$
- Price: $0.36 \times 03 = 8 \text{ cents}$
