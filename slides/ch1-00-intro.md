## What you already know

Riza's loudspeaker is making an annoying buzzing sound.
The cone of the speaker goes in and out fifty times a second.
Which is correct?

1. The amplitude of the sound vibration is 50 dB.
1. The amplitude of the sound vibration is 50 Hz.
1. The frequency of the sound vibration is 50 dB.
1. The frequency of the sound vibration is 50 Hz.

## What you already know

What voltage is the voltmeter showing?

## Convert

- 275 mV = ______ V
- 0.025 V = ______ mV
- 17 mA = ______ A

- 0.734 A = ______ mA
- 45 min = ______ h
- 0.125 h = ______ s

## Convert - answers

- 275 mV = .275 V
- 0.025 V = 25 mV
- 17 mA = 0.017 A

- 0.734 A = 734 mA
- 45 min = 0.75 h
- 0.125 h = 450 s

## Conductors vs insulators

Which conduct electric currents well?

- wood
- glass
- iron
- copper
- plastic
- silver

## Conductors vs insulators - answers

Iron, copper, and silver are conductors.
The rest are insulators.

- wood
- glass
- **iron** <- Conducts well
- **copper** <- Conducts *really well*
- plastic
- **silver** < - Conducts ***extremely** well*
